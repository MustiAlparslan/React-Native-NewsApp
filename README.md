# React-Native-NewsApp

I've developed a mobile application using React Native Expo and NewsAPI. It features daily data updates and encompasses a wide range of categories.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of Node.js and npm/yarn.
* You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine. (This project supports all these operating systems)
* You have read the documentation related to this project.

## Testing the App using Expo Go

This application can be tested on Android and iOS devices using Expo Go. Please follow the steps below:

1. Install Expo Go on your device:

   For iOS devices, [download Expo Go from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)

   For Android devices, [download Expo Go from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=tr&gl=US)

2. Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code available at the following link: [React-Native-NewsApp on Expo](https://expo.dev/@mustafabatu/newsApp?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go)

This will allow you to run and test the application directly on your device without the need for a physical build.
